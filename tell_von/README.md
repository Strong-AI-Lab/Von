# Von Component: note_assistor

This is a project started at Strong AI Lab that aims to help researchers manage notes and files in an intelligent way using AI. It will become a family of Agents for Assisted Science and beyond.

For now note_assistor uses a windowing portal as its interface and specializes in processing Google Drive using OpenAI. In the future we want it to span cloud based storage using a web-based interface (maybe Slack).
