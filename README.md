# Von

This is an open source set of projects to enhance and enrich the tasks and capabilities of academic researchers using AI. Initially, there are two (sub) projects: tell_von which helps organize notes and files, and paper_recommender which organizes and distributes paper recommendations and references. 

Hopefully this will become a family of Agents for Assisted Science and beyond.
