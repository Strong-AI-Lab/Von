Speaker 1  3:16  
The audio is bit weird. Again, If you can hear me, I can't really understand you guys.

Timothy Pistotti  3:27  
I think Kobe said that he'll set up the white box in there when he gets back on gets back this week.

Yeah, you sound like. You sound like you've taken hostages that I have no idea.

Unknown Speaker  3:59  
What bet

Unknown Speaker  4:09  
you Oh yeah, I

Timothy Pistotti  4:26  
don't know. I don't know if you're asking me a question. I can't, can't really understand you still.

Oh no, I can't see the transcription either, but I can. I can, if you talk like that, I can understand you and read your mouth, but otherwise, no idea what you say.

I don't know where to look for the transcriptions. They're not, they're not popping up for me anyway. So this

maybe, maybe I'll try and restart My screen and see if that helps. Um,

yeah, not. I think it's the same problem we had last time, and then Young did something to fix it, but I don't know What he did. I

Unknown Speaker  7:00  
Hello, hello,

Unknown Speaker  7:06  
hello, if, yeah,

Timothy Pistotti  7:27  
I can hear whatever's in there. Sounds like it's rattling a little bit. And sometimes the connection sounded like it might be getting better when you're messing with it. So it seems like that thing might be broken. Yeah, like I could hear myself that go back now that you turned it off, and I assume that the audio is fixed,

Unknown Speaker  7:48  
and we can you hear us now? Yeah, absolutely.

Unknown Speaker  7:52  
So next time this happens, the solution is to turn the hour off and on again, even though the video is working, which you would think would be the hard part for it.

Unknown Speaker  8:06  
Yeah, yeah, it

Timothy Pistotti  8:07  
sounds it sounds hilarious. I wish you could hear have fun.

Speaker 2  8:14  
Young pointed out that the transcription was not showing

Unknown Speaker  8:19  
outputs. Yeah. I assumed that it

Speaker 2  8:24  
was just words down because I couldn't understand them. But he has more faith in his speech. Nice, it's not very dark. Was actually,

Timothy Pistotti  8:34  
I thought you were saying that it was working when I was trying to read your lips there, I understood transcription, but I didn't understand it wasn't working. So our system failed

Speaker 2  8:48  
better to transcribe us, then you would know what the problem was, yeah.

Timothy Pistotti  8:59  
So yeah, so I can't see you all, but that's okay.

Unknown Speaker  9:04  
We What's that? No,

Unknown Speaker  9:09  
never mind. I was wondering,

Unknown Speaker  9:13  
yeah, so yeah,

Timothy Pistotti  9:16  
I think I mentioned in an email, I don't know if you saw it that Sarah REO had agreed to do the presentation, which was really exciting, until I got a random message from Annette Mills, who also who has not responded to anything for like, you know, since the beginning of the month or before maybe last month. And so she said she was interested as well now, but I feel like I can just potentially tell her that it's okay we found somebody, or that we could have two smaller presentations.

Speaker 2  9:54  
Is it because they were extended presentations and we don't have time for them? Or I think two smaller ones might be

Timothy Pistotti  10:02  
better. Yeah, I guess

Speaker 2  10:06  
I was there like, at least 1015, minutes, something like that. If they're an actual presentation, okay,

Timothy Pistotti  10:13  
yeah, that's good. Then I'll just, I can, I can invite her up. Then the one issue is that she's done in Canterbury, so I don't know if coming up for a 20 minute presentation is exciting for her, but I can just ask her in the message and say that that's what we have time for now. And I didn't specify with Sarah how long the presentation would need to be, or anything along those lines. So I think she'll she'll be fine as well. She recommended a friend or a colleague as that is working on cyber security stuff, but is a Maori research group that won and New Zealand high tech award for best Maori research, or something like that, this last year. And I thought that because we have two people on the we only have two people on the panel currently for organizational intelligence. I thought she might be an acceptable or he might be a reasonable

Unknown Speaker  11:10  
addition, because

Speaker 2  11:14  
security people assuming that cyber security people have anything to say about creativity, but if they're,

Timothy Pistotti  11:21  
yeah, I think, I think she said that he's a very good speaker, and he could craft his discussion towards that angle. So, more in terms of creating the product than you know, as the team, then actually trying to, yeah, I guess you still have to be creative to make some of these tools. I

Unknown Speaker  11:39  
guess so.

Unknown Speaker  11:42  
But I can send you a link to

Timothy Pistotti  11:47  
the I can send you a link to their, to that person's website if you're interested in looking, or I can just invite them, because we don't have enough people. Anyways,

Unknown Speaker  11:55  
we only have the two.

Unknown Speaker  11:59  
I think some home into three stage.

Speaker 2  12:04  
It was, it was completely incorrectly, at least it's in the hole. Now,

Timothy Pistotti  12:11  
nice progress. And then, yeah, hopefully Kobe comes and sets up like a permanent, permanent setup that you know works every time, because we have the mouse and the

Unknown Speaker  12:23  
down here that said,

Timothy Pistotti  12:26  
down there by the white box, there's a mouse and a keyboard that's just waiting to be set up with the camera and everything. So,

Unknown Speaker  12:35  
or should be there anyways, unless

Timothy Pistotti  12:38  
somebody's stolen it while we were away. But I don't think that's happened. So yeah, as far as the the symposium goes, the other thing to talk about is, I guess at some point, Ruth had offered to have a meeting, and I was CCed in on this, this email by her about how to deal with Apurva being gone, and she offered a few different solutions, one of which was to give Apurva salary worth of money to that we're entitled to.

Speaker 2  13:12  
I tried to meet her yesterday, but she she didn't reply to my emails. So I'm on top of that issue. Okay, yeah, now we should assume that she's not around. And I think the choice that I want to take is taking the money and paying for our a's, yeah? So you, yeah, you've done such a good job at this Tim. But

Timothy Pistotti  13:40  
thank you. Yeah, I've been, yeah, definitely, it's been. It was a little scary when a Puerto left, but I think that after getting all of the people lined up and this process, I think will be easier to do the next one. And yeah, I think I'm actually quite confident that we have, now that we have enough people, I'm feeling a lot more good about the event. So these things

Speaker 2  14:05  
usually come together, but you have to accept the risk that they won't doing these sorts of tasks in house for us, given that we're trying to build bond, is exactly what we should be doing. We should be trying to, you know, we should be trying to do all of these tasks once or twice and then have them done for us.

Timothy Pistotti  14:25  
Yeah, absolutely. And I think that when you're talking about setting up a different type of symposium with Gail, I think a lot of that could be a lot of the search process for looking through the the available people in the area could be automated by bond pretty, pretty quickly, if we just decide to do that. So

Speaker 2  14:45  
I wonder about a concept of research agents RAS as part of bond. Yeah,

Michael Witbrock  14:53  
agent, agent, laboratory with research agents in it, yeah. I like it the RAS, yeah,

Timothy Pistotti  15:07  
yeah, just to keep the servers going. But, um, yeah, I think the on my end, the symposiums coming together. And then just one other random note was that, like sahua idea of the capacity rollout, where basically we start to try and help Maori kids that are interested in technology to participate in building the technology. I brought that up in the last meeting with the group, and then Sarah actually messaged me afterwards and introduced me to her nephew, who's a UA Bachelor of Science student, who's a cetera speaker, and is also, yeah, so he's a comp sci Bachelor's of art student, so he's quite keen to get into AI and such. And that was, I was wondering, if you like, I guess, if it's cool, if I just kind of run with that, or if there's Yes, any concerns, yeah. And then if I do run with that, is it okay if I invite him? Okay,

Speaker 2  16:09  
yeah, just don't just check with taboo also, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  16:18  
Daniel Wilson,

Speaker 2  16:19  
if you if he's on board as well

Unknown Speaker  16:25  
the concept, yeah, okay,

Timothy Pistotti  16:29  
yeah, cool, yeah. I'll talk to I included in in the email, or like in my reply to Sarah and to her nephew. So he's, aware of it, and he's, he's, I hasn't replied to that yet, but I'll reach out and then, because I think he'll be somebody really good for guy to know. And it's, it's cool that it's happening quite quickly too, right? Like, it's just, like, not a much lower effort than I already expected, which I'm a big fan of,

Unknown Speaker  16:59  
yeah, we can use

Speaker 2  17:02  
it for part. To prototype something less organic. I'm already thinking in conversations with Damien celesa, for example.

Unknown Speaker  17:12  
We can't

Speaker 2  17:13  
make this our own role. So the great thing is, if there, if the kids involved are so motivated that they're actually contributing to the research right where, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:26  
it's when it's a win for us.

Timothy Pistotti  17:29  
I think it's already a win for us in, like, in a few different ways, in terms of just having some more legitimacy for operating in the space and, yeah, not just being yeah because there's Yeah. So that's an

Speaker 2  17:45  
instrumental win, right? Yeah, yeah. We want to steal the Amana in order to right, in order to do our own purposes right. Shared purposes are better.

Timothy Pistotti  17:58  
Yeah? And I think this guy, well, I'm quite I'm cheering for him. I haven't met him yet. Today, I'm gonna meet him today, but I'm hoping that he wants to continue into, you know, and and is excited by by some of our research. So, you know, we'll see how it goes. So hopefully I can help him in some way, and if not, I'll reach out to other to Kobe, most likely he's also on the project, but, yeah, that's kind of kind of the

Unknown Speaker  18:27  
somehow related to that.

Unknown Speaker  18:31  
My

Speaker 2  18:32  
brother in law wants to take on the task of trying to bring one of those robots back to life.

Timothy Pistotti  18:38  
Oh, wow. Okay, cool. Is he? Is he in the field? Is he? Is that something he could do? He's a kind

Speaker 2  18:46  
of engineer, and he, I think he might be able to do it. Yeah, very least, he found the site which seems to have new versions of their operating system, which we, we as a group, failed to do.

Timothy Pistotti  19:01  
Oh, we found the new versions of their operating system, but we weren't able to get them. We weren't able to, yeah, to install them,

Speaker 2  19:12  
to get it to either take them or you couldn't plug them into the USB port. It would be good. It would be good to have availabe. I'll get him to come in and talk to you guys about what heaven. I don't know if he can get further than you, but he's got time on his hand. And, oh, cool,

Timothy Pistotti  19:34  
yeah, I'm sure he can get further than me. I think if we could organize it when Gail's around, Gail was the one that was the closest to, I think, anyways, was the closest at getting it's actually work. But, yeah, it was. It was an interesting hackathon kind of event. I think we could do better next time, if we set it up a little differently, but

Unknown Speaker  19:59  
alive. Yeah,

Timothy Pistotti  20:01  
yeah, yeah. So I'm back next week, and then Kobe's back next week as well. So maybe we can start, start working on that together, and figure out, figure out how to get those robots to carry us things that we need. And, you know, take notes, fix cameras, whatever,

Speaker 1  20:19  
whatever it is. Open the doors, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  20:26  
I'm told that I will get access to all the corridors.

Timothy Pistotti  20:30  
Oh, nice. Wait, you told your does your brother and I, you said,

Speaker 2  20:36  
for the robots, yes. But in other methods, I'm told that in Newmarket I will be able to go in and out of all corridors shortly, like in any of the buildings. Yeah. So maybe you guys will too as Oh, wow, yeah. So Jim Benson has promised that anywhere in the building's problem will be solved. So

Timothy Pistotti  21:03  
we'll see amazing, but congratulations, small miracles,

Speaker 2  21:07  
exactly. So you have to be careful not to be encouraged and whining, right? Because it can become a victim. I think

Timothy Pistotti  21:19  
it gets results, I guess,

Unknown Speaker  21:23  
yeah, that's, that's more

Timothy Pistotti  21:25  
or less my staff update that I have available. But how's the, how's the von von stuff going?

Speaker 3  21:36  
I'm planning to add the new features of one project. I mean, can the public company automatically maintain a public publication brackets, like if you send an image or send your message to the flag published paper? And that kind of information can automatically captured by the one agent, and it will access report to be, say, a Excel file, or some others might I'd

Speaker 2  22:06  
like that one after the first solution to be proactive, like if, if two things, if you appear on a publication that someone else submitted to it, it could remind You that perhaps you could have thought about, you know, maybe you could submit it to or actually ask you about your role on that publication. Yeah, that would be really useful. So, and what your particular insults were just asked you to talk to it for a few minutes about that publication. The other thing is, if you haven't had a pub, if you haven't submitted the publication in the last six months. Should not just ask about ones which have been published. It should be asking about ones which are in preparation, right? Yeah, so if you haven't, if you haven't said that you've got one in preparation in the last three months, I think something like that, it should, it should ask. Are you thinking about any that should help you for information? It should all be very, very, very friendly and not, not act like, where the hell haven't you given me any publications recently? Yeah,

Speaker 3  23:17  
so we can integrate all of the functions into one single Publication Manager and helper in the one project.

Speaker 2  23:26  
But also think about doing it with a minimum amount of code. Can you describe what the process of doing the publication is, right? So

Unknown Speaker  23:36  
other than that process, well,

Speaker 2  23:40  
like what I was saying, you should have a way. If someone tells you that they've got a publication, you should recognize it, right? It shouldn't be a separate interface or anything. If anyone tells you on Slack or by email or anything like that, it should recognize it. So, how do we, how do we have that happen, right? So we just described this is the publication task, recognize if someone sends a public

Unknown Speaker  24:06  
habit in the current time bond product, right?

Michael Witbrock  24:11  
In that case, how do we tell it that it's got a classifier for publications and that it should apply it to all the incoming messages, right? And recognize a publication. And then, you know, tell it where. How does it know where to store the publications? Right? Does it have at the moment, should we widen the use of that database to being able to store other kinds of persistent information? If so, how do we tell it what the type of persistent

Speaker 2  24:38  
information is, what kind of workflow? So what's the kind of instead of building code, what's the highest

Speaker 3  24:45  
level intention that we not only store the publications we publish, but also the publication we shared? Select,

Michael Witbrock  24:56  
yes, but it can tell the difference between them, right? But more than that, it's like, how do we describe, say, in natural language this publication tracking task, right? And what components do we have to build so it can take that publication tracking task, break it up into a workflow, right? And then know that it should try that workflow every now and then, right? So the less, the less code, which is anything to do with publications that we have in the system, the better. I suspect that we I suspect that you don't actually need any, that there's something like a description of the sort of information you need about a publication, right? And we can ask it to produce that description itself, because it's got access to, you know, what are the different kinds of publications? Okay, for each of those kinds of publications, what kind of information should I store? If it notice, if it then it should think about those right? Work out whether there is a small set of fields which covers all of them, right? Then, if there's one kind of publication which has a unique field, maybe ask a person whether that's actually something you need to know. You know, I mean, like, if we can build that for publications, right then, for example, we ought to be able to tell it how to track PhD applicants. There'll be a while before we have to solve some security problems before that. Yeah. So how can we help we make it so that in so in years time, we could sit here and tell it about a new task, a new kind of task that we want it to perform, and it will proactively ask people in the lab all the questions that it knows in order to work out what the workflow is and then execute it. And

Speaker 2  26:58  
wherever possible, we should probably store things like the workflow in but if it comes up with a workflow, it should be a JIRA workflow, right? And it should actually install that workflow in JIRA and be able to access Endura. Now, it can keep notes for itself about how that works, right, but the primary place where it implements these things should be in the systems that we that we use, because then they'll be better for us as well. Yeah, so that's a bit of a rental. I'm glad, I'm glad that Ronaldo is present for this part, this meeting, at least. So that's if we can make that work at all there's like an almost endless stream of publications we can get out of it, right?

Unknown Speaker  27:49  
All right, so let's

Speaker 2  27:55  
think, in a way, yeah, let's use this. This your this publication tracking thing, which we've been doing badly, right? And, yeah, let's get that. Let's try and have some little version of it working within two weeks to a month. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. And it and let's have this one is the first one that we're going to try and persuade other people in the School of Computer Science to use. Because, yeah, there are various bits and pieces of it, like for our publication tracking. Can we work out how to automatically update the WordPress stuff with the publication list? Can we work out how to update our individual pages or the or is the university system working well enough? Or the thing you know, the how to update them in our ORCID profiles, for example, which I think the university system and how does, how does Bob ask the questions that needs to know, to know that that might be effective at the University of Auckland, right? But that's a very general thing. Would work anywhere in the world, and in particular it would work here, yeah, right. So there's that, you know, that's what we're after with this project. I think it's really exciting. I think, you know, I think we could deal if we act quickly, we can be the one that all the labs adopt. So

Speaker 3  29:28  
within the or within the world, within the world,

Timothy Pistotti  29:33  
nice, so in when it's asking the questions, are you also like imagining it proposing code as well. Or is that that too far for like, how to build a feature that it wants?

Speaker 2  29:45  
Well, of course, it can do that. I mean, I use that capability now. Why the heck wouldn't it, right? Yeah, there are some things in the European Union, AI app, which comes into force,

Michael Witbrock  29:59  
I think at the end of this month, Vaughn make a note, go off and read the European AI act and see whether it threatens us. It probably doesn't, especially since we're a university. But there are some things in the or

Speaker 2  30:16  
there were planned to be some things in there about self modifying systems, and we are definitely planning, I don't even know what that what's the difference between adding a record in a database which changes your behavior, right, and adding new code, I Don't know, right?

Unknown Speaker  30:39  
There is a difference really

Speaker 2  30:40  
redesigning a cognitive architecture, like redesigning taking over from Kobe and, you know, designing a cognitive architecture, alright, that's clearly in this sort of scope, but, yeah, but working that out, you're working out what is safe and appropriate where, well, having a working assumption that most of the things that we are likely to do

Timothy Pistotti  31:13  
Safe, safe and appropriate? Yeah, right.

Speaker 2  31:16  
No, no, not the assumption that everything is a existential risk or is doing somebody some harm that we should be held responsible for? We can't. We can't operate under that assumption. But it's it is a question that we should continuously ask ourselves, and a capability that we might think about building into the system is when there is a work even a workflow change, for it to consider whether or not there will be unintended consequences, and they don't have to be actual harms, just will it disrupt other workflows, for Example. But yeah, that's the sort of reasoning that human organizations are incapable of doing, right? The university in particular has shown itself to be, yeah, it's not at fault, right? But universities and other organizations are utterly incapable of taking into account the cost of their proposed policies on other things which are important to them, right? So let's, let's see if we can find, like, some little, tiny case

Unknown Speaker  32:28  
of that,

Speaker 2  32:32  
like, yeah, for example, if it was asking every day, have you published something, right? You know that will cause both demoralization and people to ignore it, yeah, and use the actual 10 seconds every day that people spend deleting as email. So that sort of reasoning it should, it should start to do, right? So this is all super ambitious, but we need but a minimal, proactive thing, which we can then choose to be, whereas actually asking you for things through slack or through email and understanding the replies that would be that would be good, almost as quickly as the publications, we should be doing that for

Unknown Speaker  33:25  
projects as well,

Speaker 2  33:29  
right? So after the publications, I think, I think to move on for is harvesting projects out of Canvas, right? Interviewing people to find out more about their projects, including their publication plans, which is why this all has to work in a uniform way, right? Because it shouldn't matter when you tell them about a publication,

Unknown Speaker  33:50  
right? Because we're getting it coming in here,

Speaker 2  33:54  
and as we're going together, you're having to add that feature young Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  33:59  
Some

Speaker 3  34:00  
minor things that just I sent the email from the school. That's the content 2025, rounds of MB application been started. So if you launch some of the application, I think, with true stuff now, and I can interact with interactively,

Unknown Speaker  34:22  
writing or make sure I'm involved in that writing? Yeah, I think,

Speaker 2  34:32  
yeah. In terms of, apparently, the first thing we have to produce is a lean canvas presentation. It's like someone paid American thing, hospital project,

Speaker 3  34:51  
hospital, to some extent, to can be,

Unknown Speaker  34:55  
yeah, and we should work.

Speaker 2  35:01  
So there's a bunch of sort of people interested now, I think it will be quite don't necessarily just throw everything into same project. We might actually want to propose two separate projects where one, right? The thing, the thing that will happen is anywhere where people are writing grant projects with multiple people, but especially in New Zealand, is the warm convert towards the lowest common denominator, right? So the thing that everybody in the group thinks that they can do without much work given given half a chance, that's what humans will do. So it might be necessary to split it up into sort of multiple projects, one of which is the most technically ambitious thing, which I think we presume is the thing that we're proposing, and then other things which are interesting in their own right. Wouldn't be bad if they got funded right and will synergise with the technically challenging part when it's availabe. I don't think that's the approach, so don't, don't. Let's assume that we're just writing that just because we've got, you know, Jill and Michael and other people's on board, which will be helpful that that should shape. If that looks like it's shaping the project too much, it's probably time to think about submitting the project, which doesn't mean that, you know, in the technically most challenging version of it wouldn't be at all surprising for Jill to be involved in that it's just in a slightly different role and

Speaker 3  36:42  
we're going to have two new master students that will be working on the basketball behavior analytics

Speaker 2  36:48  
project. So tell Kobe that we are we? If he's interested, he can be somehow involved, yeah. So we need to work out what the two projects sounds like 111, challenging one where we're trying to qualify someone for to stay with us for a PhD, and one less challenging one where we're trying to get a good industry placement, where we send them off to basketball New Zealand, and they build an actual system for them.

Unknown Speaker  37:19  
So and if I

Speaker 3  37:21  
have 6k budget to purchase some additional equipment for this meeting room and also for our team, so I plan to request a iPad with a pencil, Apple pencil to so we can draw something to show our idea, make our idea more clear. And if you have something you want to you want to purchase, just let me know, and I will add them to the list. And to one is to focus approval.

Speaker 2  37:49  
Actually, one thing that might be good is also a remarkable pad, which is another way of doing the same thing, right, another way of capturing data. So,

Speaker 3  37:59  
yeah, but the hardest, it's not easy to protect. The remarkable, yeah,

Speaker 2  38:05  
it's not easy to predict. If you don't necessarily, you don't need to project that one with that one. It's you take notes, and it can automatically sync them and capture them. And so it's very it's sort of got the back end support on is pretty good, and the automated doing reading and text extraction and stuff like that, image drawing extraction, so I might be interesting.

Unknown Speaker  38:32  
So are we?

Speaker 2  38:36  
Yeah, are we on the path of getting set up with, is the audio recording good enough at the moment in this room condition,

Speaker 3  38:47  
I upgrade the system, but it's all this day, and now it works on my laptop very well. Okay, all right.

Speaker 2  38:57  
So one thing that, since I might be doing some advising for a company that wants to do stuff with audio inside, I think it's okay to say audio inside ambulances. And it strikes me that maybe there's some synergy there. For example, this room doesn't have to be the only place we're recording audio from. I would like to have the same capability in my office, so that when people just Yeah, because at the moment, it's like, if you know, if I remember to turn on the screen, and if otter both decides that it wants to show up, then maybe we get a recording. I'd like it to be better than that. We should also experiment with automatically working out when it's likely that it should be recording and when it's likely that it shouldn't. So doing things like perhaps continuous space recognition inside my office, so that it knows who's in there all the time. Well, actually, can you all additional all to your office? Maybe, maybe that I've already got a already got a Jabra camera, which is pretty good, so it's like a multi focus automatic zoom and zoom out camera. So I think that's probably good enough, and using a variety of things, but plugging it in in a way that it's continuously

Unknown Speaker  40:29  
opera,

Speaker 2  40:32  
yeah. I mean doing that continuously, and having it able to work with Zoom, for example, do we need to? Do we need to work out how to do some sort of low level turn one is there a software to turn one camera into two virtual cameras, one of which Zoom is using, and one of which a continuous recorder is using? For example? Yeah, that's and the same with microphones. There probably is now that I say it right, yeah, but

Speaker 3  41:02  
it's better to have two separate cameras. It wants to have that.

Speaker 2  41:07  
Yeah, I think it's certainly easier. It's probably better to do the virtual thing right in the long term. But it'll certainly be easier to, you know what? If you're away somewhere, and you're only got your laptop right, and you have a choice of zoom or

Speaker 1  41:24  
for that? So I think having more also, like,

Speaker 2  41:35  
eventually, like the corridor, more spaces that are monitored in this way? Yeah, I'm not sure whether it's time to do that more widely. Probably not, but let's make sure that we have the equipment to expand if we

Unknown Speaker  41:51  
need to

Timothy Pistotti  41:55  
one one, since we're talking about cameras, I had suggested before getting like a DSLR or something for conferences and stuff. But I kind of am backing off that idea in favor of something for video recording. And I feel like having a higher definition recording set up for these meetings or for our conferences would be motivating for being able to put things like post things online in terms of, yeah, like, if we have kind of a dodgy recording of of the conference, I feel less excited about posting that, as opposed to, like, something a little bit higher quality, quality. So if we could get one of those, get some sort of setup, whatever that looks like, for free from from him, then that'd be, I think, a good, a good idea, but,

Unknown Speaker  42:46  
yeah, but yeah, let's,

Speaker 2  42:50  
let's spend their money on the most widely useful thing. So I think, yeah, let's not get something which is ridiculously

Unknown Speaker  43:03  
good, right, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  43:06  
But if there's like a $1,000

Timothy Pistotti  43:11  
this should be right, like, because cameras on your phone, DSLRs

Speaker 2  43:15  
now do video recording, right? So, yeah, a halfway decent camera, where, if you imagine that we start doing blog posts, or that phone starts encouraging us to do, starts interviewing us, yeah, for example, in virtual form, yeah.

Timothy Pistotti  43:40  
So. In terms of like costs, though, it's like the cheapest camera person or photographers, like $1,200 for one event. So

Speaker 2  43:51  
I mean, after this, let's find a way of stopping doing that. Yeah. I don't want to continue. Not photographers,

Timothy Pistotti  44:01  
yeah. So I feel like, if we, if we get a free camera for you know, that saves us having to buy it ourselves, and then also saves us $1,200 every every event, plus gives us more ability to take better, yeah, like to make more more media content if we want to. Yeah, price one and

Unknown Speaker  44:25  
discuss with young okay.

Speaker 2  44:27  
I mean, it's only $6,000 which isn't very much. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  44:33  
$6,000 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I

Timothy Pistotti  44:35  
don't want to eat up a lot of money. Or if you think it's a bad idea, we don't need to. But I do think

Speaker 2  44:41  
there's a bad idea, but we are running out of money. A better use of money is to continue paying people beyond the end of September, generally, all other things being equal, that's probably not actually true, but let's pretend

Timothy Pistotti  44:58  
it's true. Yeah, from certain perspectives. It's definitely seems like a good idea. Cool, yeah, I don't have any other purchasing ideas. So

Unknown Speaker  45:10  
that's, that's about it for me.

Speaker 2  45:13  
Well, I noticed that the transcript is not 100% accurate. So something about how you know, something about the system in here could probably be improved.

Unknown Speaker  45:29  
Yeah, I think

Unknown Speaker  45:31  
you know something of it. Yeah,

Timothy Pistotti  45:35  
the microphone, you know, it doesn't sound like super high quality, so it could be that, but I would imagine, does this

Speaker 3  45:42  
microphone work or not? No, no, okay, it's not

Timothy Pistotti  45:49  
bad. It's just and

Unknown Speaker  45:52  
large library, model, API to the library. Stuff has as the chatgpt API, yeah, added to the libraries in Python. Yes.

Speaker 2  46:08  
Okay, yeah. So I think there's a directory, I think, where everything's kind of libraries, right, yeah. So everything which is, everything which is kind of services that Bon is using, as opposed to about the system itself, should go in the

Unknown Speaker  46:25  
in that library. So if,

Speaker 4  46:28  
if people just use the links common, such as the exposed API key, and they can use chicken and project directly. Yeah, Lindsay, he stays,

Speaker 2  46:44  
yeah, it should. It should be that if you set the environment variable with the API key, it should just work, okay, however you set the environment variable in nineness, there's one way in Windows. There's another way in macOS. It's probably similar for lineups,

Speaker 3  47:06  
all right, I'll make it this equipment for and send you for for review, and they found something you want to buy or something you are interested in on TV, tech website, you can send a link to me and I add them to the beast. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  47:20  
yeah, cool.

Timothy Pistotti  47:22  
Does anybody in the lab? Do you know anybody that's interested in camera stuff so that I don't you know, have to

Speaker 3  47:35  
ask the do not want to afford, although does not want to pay for a system less than 5k so this should be more than 5k okay.

Speaker 2  47:47  
How much is the budget? 6000 6000 Yes, but

Speaker 3  47:53  
the multiply system, AB system, more than 5k I see it's interesting.

Unknown Speaker  48:01  
That's weird. I don't understand that. But okay,

Timothy Pistotti  48:04  
so we they want to buy an AV system that is more than 5k and then basically we have, yeah, yeah. Okay, all right. Well, yeah, yes, I need your list of stuff, and we'll talk it out.

Speaker 2  48:20  
Well, the camera can be part of that IV system perhaps? Yeah, I

Timothy Pistotti  48:23  
think so, yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 3  48:27  
Well, alternatively, you can make a list of multiple sector devices, and the total price can be higher than 5k that's

Timothy Pistotti  48:37  
also, yeah, I don't think we need a five, $5,000 camera. So, yeah, sweet. All right. Well, then I'll see you guys. I'm gonna go make a coffee, and I'll see you guys in 40 minutes, eh? Unless there's anything else when you

Speaker 2  48:54  
think, Well, when you're thinking about this, think about the fact that we're doing this basketball thing and that we may need to capture basketball games.

Timothy Pistotti  49:01  
Okay, oh yeah, Kobe's gonna be availabe

Speaker 2  49:04  
basketball court as a new kind of Meerkat. Then, yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  49:10  
already have data, yeah, on the camera's capture the

Speaker 2  49:13  
behavior, okay, so maybe check to make sure that the data is kind of similar to the data we've got for the meerkats.

Unknown Speaker  49:26  
Make sure that we get

Timothy Pistotti  49:27  
some courtside tickets for the basketball games as well, so that we can really observe

Unknown Speaker  49:33  
what's happening. I

Timothy Pistotti  49:39  
don't even know what the basketball teams are in New Zealand I've met

Speaker 3  49:44  
or America. Yeah, basketball is not a mainstream sport in New Zealand. I mean, if we

Speaker 2  49:52  
succeed at this, we can sell it to the Netball people who probably New Zealand have more money. Nice, all right, there was something else that I have at the back of my mind, but I can't remember, so maybe next time,

Unknown Speaker  50:09  
I didn't mean to cut

Unknown Speaker  50:12  
you off. So that'll be good for now, let us know what we said. Otter,

Unknown Speaker  50:21  
yeah,

Timothy Pistotti  50:22  
thanks otter for hanging around,

Unknown Speaker  50:26  
for showing up. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  50:44  
I Think we Can But We
