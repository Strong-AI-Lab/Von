# This file will encapsulate the basic idea of a unit of effort for a Von agent.
# An effort unit is a single unit of effort that a Von agent can perform. 
# Effort units are stored in a MongoDB database.
# Effort units represent Tasks, Projects, Sub-Tasks, 
# and other units of work that a Von agent can perform.
# They can contain other effort units, and can be assigned to Von agents.
# Types of Effort Units are described in natural language, and can be used to generate 
# code, or work-flows of other effort units. Some effort units can be used to generate
# prompts that will cause LLMs to perform inference, producing or updating intermediate states 
# generating outputs, or generating new Effort Units.

# See paper_recommender/mangodb/crud.py which already defines an idea of Project which
# probably can be used as a basis for this class.
